# knights_travails_ruby

This project gives you the shortest path a chess knight can do from one square to another. For that it uses the Breadth-first-search algorithm.

To use it you just need to change the starting and ending point in the knight_moves method in knights_travail.rb, being a 8x8 board rows and columns range from 0-7.
